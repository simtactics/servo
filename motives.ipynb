    "The Motive Engine is based on opposing weights. An object signals it's presence if the Sims' need is low. The need is the motive and that drives a Sims' decision. All games in the franchise are based on this dynamic at it's core. For example, if hunger is low then the fridge's presence is high and vice versa. The sum of all the Sims' needs is it's mood. A Sim will only choose the fridge if it increases it's overall mood. The sum of all the Sims' needs is it's mood. A Sim will only choose the fridge if it increases it's overall mood. The ML portion comes in deciding which has the priority."
