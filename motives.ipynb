    "The Motive Engine is based on opposing weights. An object signals it's presence if the Sim's need is low. The need is the motive and that drives a Sims' decision. All games in the franchise are based on this dynamic at it's core. For example, if hunger is low then the fridge's presence is high and vice versa. A Sim's mood is the sum of the current state of their motives. They will only choose the fridge if it increases it's overall mood. The ML portion comes in deciding which has the priority.\n",

    "A Sim's motives decrease in increments and independently of each other during game play. They are randomized for this experiment. "
