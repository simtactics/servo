Servo is a experimental re-implementation of SimAntics using ML.NET based on [Under the Hood of The Sims](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~forbus/c95-gd/lectures/The_Sims_Under_the_Hood_files/v3_document.htm). I have wanted to write my own version of SimAntics for a while but the process of rewriting the engine from scratch or even maintaining an existing re-implementation, such as FreeSO's, has proven to be tedious. Current machine learning technologies, such as ML.NET, can streamline the process. That being said, Servo is not intended to be used to rewrite The Sims itself. The models are intended for building new games based on it's design.
